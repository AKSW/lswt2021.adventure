# WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit

This is a starter kit to help you build your own map for [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

## Tools you will need

In order to build your own map for WorkAdventure, you need:

- the [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software
- "tiles" (i.e. images) to create your map (this starter kit provides a good default tileset for offices)
- a web-server to serve your map (this starter kit proposes to use Github static pages as a web-server which is both free and performant)

## Getting started

On the [Github repository page](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure-map-starter-kit),
click the **"Use this template"** button. You will be prompted to enter a repository name for your map.
