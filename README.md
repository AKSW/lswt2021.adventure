# Map for the LSWT2021 Adventure

This is based on the starter kit to help you build your own map for [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

To understand how to use this starter kit, follow the tutorial at [https://workadventu.re/map-building](https://workadventu.re/map-building). As a software you just need https://www.mapeditor.org/, which is easy to use.

This map shall become the map to be used for the LSWT2021 (https://lswt2021.aksw.org/). And can already be played in a test setup at https://aksw.github.io/lswt2021.adventure/.

Please send you updates as pullr-equests so that we have a chance that a second person checks if it works, and feel free to merge the pull requests as long as you can ensure a peer-review by someone.

The world should be fun for everyone. It should include:

- a main stage for the presenters
- an area for the audience to watch the stream from the main stage
- an area for poster rooms/boths/stands for students
- areas to hang out, meet and chat
